Next, I'll be detailing a systematic learning path, including essential algorithms such as BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra.    I'm now structuring the learning approach. I'll define graphs, covering vertices, edges, and their relationships. I will then explain directed/undirected, weighted graphs, and adjacency matrix/list representations. I'm focusing on a methodical learning path, including BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, and Prim's/Kruskal's algorithms. I will also highlight the importance of coding practice and suggest helpful resources.   Graphs are another crucial data structure in DSA. They consist of vertices (or nodes) and edges that connect them. To learn about them, you can start by understanding the different types, such as directed and undirected graphs, as well as weighted and unweighted graphs. Key representations include adjacency matrices and adjacency lists. A good learning path involves studying core algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths, and minimum spanning tree algorithms. Practice is key, so solving problems on coding platforms will be very helpful. Are you looking for specific resources like textbooks or online courses?",

The plan then proceeds to core data structures, and I am listing arrays and linked lists for now. It is important to emphasize linked lists and their variations. This feels like a solid starting point for building the rest of the outline.    I've expanded the outline to encompass the essential areas for DSA preparation. I've broken it down into fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, and the critical practice component. The data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees (binary, balanced, heaps), graphs (directed, undirected, and representations), and hash tables. Algorithms cover sorting, searching, graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.), dynamic programming, backtracking, and recursion.    I'm now integrating algorithms into the framework, creating a structured list for DSA preparation. I've compiled an algorithm section covering sorting (bubble, merge, quick, etc.), searching (linear, binary), and graph algorithms, as well as backtracking, dynamic programming and recursion. Finally, I'll emphasize the practical application component, recommending coding platforms for problem-solving.   To prepare for DSA, you'll want to cover a range of topics. It's helpful to start with fundamentals like time and space complexity (Big O notation) to analyze algorithms. Core data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees (especially binary and binary search trees), heaps, and graphs. For algorithms, focus on sorting and searching algorithms, graph algorithms like BFS and DFS, dynamic programming, and recursion. And remember, consistent practice on coding platforms is key.",

I've been examining the user's question, focusing on the interplay between default pause detection and instruction-based response timing. It seems the core query is how my response delay adjusts when the system prompt includes specific wait instructions. I've concluded that the system prompt *does* override any baked-in pause behavior. I am flexible and adaptable based on instructions.    My focus is clarifying the priority of the system prompt. I've been working to distill a clear explanation of how the system prompt influences my behavior, especially concerning pauses. The key is that instructions *always* override default pause detection. The system prompt is the primary driver of timing, including any specific wait times.   My behavior, including how I handle pauses, is influenced by the instructions in my system prompt.
